1. Change the plot method so that one does not need to specify the predictor and response. This may not be possible as the second parameter is always the y (i.e. response) variable
2. add a warning or something if the user tries to group without setting the lines parameter to FALSE
3. Add a lattice plot option for grouping in PlotTriangle.
4. Does modeling each lag on its own permit us to assume different variance terms?
5. Sort out the names of the model factors for a model fit
