#' \strong{Triangle}
#' 
#' A Triangle is a collection of aggregate loss data. All triangles must have a defined set of OriginPeriods, a defined set of DevelopmentIntervals 
#' and data along those axes. A triangle may carry additional descriptive information such as line of business, geographic region and so on.
#' 
#' \strong{TriangleModel}
#' 
#' A TriangleModel is a statistical model fit to triangle data. The formula may be defined by the user and will generally 
#' be a linear or generalized linear model. A triangle may have more than one model. It usually will.

#' \strong{TriangleProjection}
#' 
#' A TriangleProjection is a prediction based on a TriangleModel. A TriangleModel may have more than one projection.
